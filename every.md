# every.dev – Demo UI Website (Vite)

## Project Overview

**every.dev** is a demo UI website built with **Vite** to showcase a new on-chain utility token designed for developers launching meme coins or serious crypto projects.

The core idea:
> If you want to launch a *real* project on-chain, you need to hold **every.dev**.

Token holders unlock **tiered access** to infrastructure, people, liquidity, and distribution based on how many tokens they hold. This website is **not a full dApp** — it is a **high-quality demo UI / marketing site** that clearly communicates the value proposition and access tiers.

This scope is written for an AI coding assistant (Claude) to implement cleanly and deterministically.
